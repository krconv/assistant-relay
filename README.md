# Introduction
This is a webserver that will relay any command to Google Asistant. It was
created to allow for making it easier for projects to access the Google
Assistant APIs; instead of needing to setup an OAuth configuration for each
project, projects can use this webserver.

## Features
 - Send commands to Google Assistant via REST
 - Use a configurable secret token to authenticate requests
